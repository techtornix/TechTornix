      <li>Use <b>composite indexes</b> for queries filtering multiple columns.</li>
      <li>Leverage <b>covering indexes</b> so queries avoid hitting the base table.</li>
      <li>Apply <b>partial indexes</b> to reduce overhead on large datasets.</li>
      <li>Balance indexing carefully—over-indexing slows down writes and increases storage use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Query Optimization</h2>
    <p>Efficient queries reduce load on servers and improve user experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rewrite <b>subqueries as joins</b> for better performance.</li>
      <li>Use <b>LIMIT with pagination</b> instead of returning huge datasets.</li>
      <li>Eliminate <b>SELECT *</b> to reduce unnecessary column fetching.</li>
      <li>Profile queries with <code>EXPLAIN</code> and <code>ANALYZE</code> to optimize execution plans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Server Configuration Tuning</h2>
    <p>Optimized server configs are crucial:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set <code>innodb_buffer_pool_size</code> to ~70% of RAM for caching indexes and data.</li>
      <li>Enable <code>query_cache</code> selectively (deprecated in newer versions).</li>
      <li>Monitor with <b>MySQL Performance Schema</b> for insights.</li>
      <li>Enable slow query logs to identify problem queries in production.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scaling Approaches</h2>
    <p>When vertical scaling hits limits, horizontal strategies are necessary:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use <b>read replicas</b> for distributing SELECT-heavy workloads.</li>
      <li>Apply <b>sharding</b> for massive datasets (e.g., user data by region).</li>
      <li>Introduce <b>caching layers</b> like Redis or Memcached for frequent lookups.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
    <p>Facebook and Uber use sharding + caching extensively to handle billions of queries daily. Proper optimization reduces infrastructure costs by up to 40%.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>MySQL optimization is continuous. Regular indexing reviews, query audits, and scaling strategies ensure databases remain fast, reliable, and ready for growth.</p>

    title: 'Cloud Architecture Patterns: Building Scalable Apps with AWS and Azure',
    slug: 'cloud-architecture-patterns-aws-azure',
    excerpt: 'Learn essential cloud patterns, design principles, and real-world strategies for building scalable, resilient applications on AWS and Azure.',
    content: `
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Cloud-native architecture is more than migration—it's about rethinking applications for scalability, resilience, and efficiency. AWS and Azure provide tools to build highly distributed systems, but success depends on applying the right design patterns.</p>

    <h2>Core Architecture Patterns</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Microservices</b>: Break monoliths into loosely coupled services for faster deployments and independent scaling.</li>
      <li><b>Serverless</b>: Use event-driven compute like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions to reduce costs and scale instantly.</li>
      <li><b>Containers</b>: Deploy portable workloads with Docker and orchestrate with Kubernetes or ECS/AKS.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scaling & Resilience Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Leverage <b>Auto Scaling Groups</b> (AWS) or <b>VM Scale Sets</b> (Azure) to match workload demand.</li>
      <li>Distribute load with <b>Application Load Balancers</b> and Azure Traffic Manager.</li>
      <li>Apply the <b>Strangler Fig Pattern</b> for phased modernization of legacy systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AWS-Specific Best Practices</h2>
    <p>AWS offers global-scale services like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>S3</b> for durable object storage (99.999999999% durability).</li>
      <li><b>DynamoDB</b> for low-latency NoSQL databases.</li>
      <li><b>CloudFront</b> for content delivery at edge locations worldwide.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Azure-Specific Best Practices</h2>
    <p>Azure provides enterprise-focused solutions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Cosmos DB</b> for multi-model, globally distributed databases.</li>
      <li><b>Blob Storage</b> for cost-effective, large-scale data storage.</li>
      <li><b>Azure Monitor</b> for observability across distributed systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hybrid & Multi-Cloud Strategies</h2>
    <p>To avoid vendor lock-in, organizations are adopting multi-cloud. Kubernetes, Istio, and Terraform enable consistent deployments across AWS, Azure, and on-prem environments. Gartner predicts 75% of enterprises will adopt hybrid/multi-cloud by 2026.</p>

    <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
    <p>Netflix uses AWS-based microservices for massive scaling, while Adobe relies on Azure services for SaaS offerings. Both showcase how cloud-native design accelerates innovation and reliability.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Cloud architecture patterns are blueprints for the future. By adopting microservices, serverless, and hybrid strategies, developers can build applications that scale globally while maintaining resilience and cost efficiency.</p>
